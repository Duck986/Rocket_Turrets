# Rocket Turrets
![mod thumbnail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wyrrrd/Rocket_Turrets/master/thumbnail.png)

(Please note: This is a quick and dirty port to 0.18. As soon as the original is ported to 0.18, this will be removed.)

Description:
- This mod adds rocket turrets to make rockets great againâ„¢.
- The mod is designed to work with Bob's, but you can also use it without. Sadly you would only get one single, boring, depressingly gray type of turret.
- Please think a moment before you load atomic rockets... because it probably won't end well...
